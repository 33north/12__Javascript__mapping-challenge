Created an interactive map displaying earthquake data taken from the United States Geological Survey (USGS) website.

It maps out all the earthquakes that occur within the week.  The map shows the magnitude of the earthquake by the size of the circles on the map and each circle is filled with a color based on the depth of the earthquake.  Clicking on each earthquake point will show a popup that lists out the location the earthquake occurred, the time and date of the earthquake, link to JSON details about the earthquake, and magnitude and depth of the earthquake.
